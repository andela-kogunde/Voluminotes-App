Today, as we carry on with our daily activities, we tend to plan towards every action and/or decision we make, the outcome *(success or failure)* eventually leads to a story, some we **record**, while some fades away, not because we want them to but because we write this stories on our **books, journal or paper** and as time goes by these materials get filled up, worn out or lost.

Writers are leaders as the saying goes, but how can one make a better leader when his/her writing materials are worn out.

The question is... How can this be solved?
